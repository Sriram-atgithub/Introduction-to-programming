# Kaggle: Intro to Programming

This repository contains notebooks from Kaggle's "Intro to Programming" course. It is designed to help you learn the basics of programming through hands-on lessons, tutorials, and exercises. Each section builds foundational skills that are essential for anyone beginning their programming journey. This course covers key topics like arithmetic, variables, functions, data types, conditions, and lists.

## Course Structure

The course is divided into five main sections, each with a **lesson**, **tutorial**, and an **exercise**. Below is a breakdown of the sections:

### 1. Arithmetic and Variables
In this section, you'll learn how to:
- Perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).
- Create and manipulate variables to store data.
  
**Notebooks Included:**
- `1.1_Arithmetic_Lesson.ipynb`: Introduces arithmetic operations and variables.
- `1.2_Arithmetic_Tutorial.ipynb`: Walks you through calculations using variables in Python.
- `1.3_Arithmetic_Exercise.ipynb`: Exercises to practice making calculations and modifying variables.

### 2. Functions
Functions allow you to organize your code and reuse blocks of code efficiently. You'll cover:
- Defining your own functions.
- Understanding function inputs and outputs.
- Avoiding redundancy by using functions.
  
**Notebooks Included:**
- `2.1_Functions_Lesson.ipynb`: Covers the basics of defining and calling functions.
- `2.2_Functions_Tutorial.ipynb`: Step-by-step examples to help you write efficient functions.
- `2.3_Functions_Exercise.ipynb`: Practice creating and using functions.

### 3. Data Types
This section introduces you to fundamental data types such as integers, floats, booleans, and strings, helping you:
- Understand different types of data in Python.
- Work with basic type conversions.
  
**Notebooks Included:**
- `3.1_Data_Types_Lesson.ipynb`: Explanation of integers, floats, booleans, and strings.
- `3.2_Data_Types_Tutorial.ipynb`: Walkthrough on using different data types in Python.
- `3.3_Data_Types_Exercise.ipynb`: Exercises to strengthen your knowledge of data types.

### 4. Conditions and Conditional Statements
Conditional statements allow your programs to make decisions. You'll learn how to:
- Use `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements to control the flow of your code.
- Write programs that respond differently based on the input.
  
**Notebooks Included:**
- `4.1_Conditions_Lesson.ipynb`: Introduction to conditional statements.
- `4.2_Conditions_Tutorial.ipynb`: Examples of writing and understanding conditions.
- `4.3_Conditions_Exercise.ipynb`: Practice using conditions to make decisions in code.

### 5. Intro to Lists
Lists allow you to store and organize multiple pieces of data efficiently. In this section, you'll:
- Create and manipulate lists.
- Access and modify elements within a list.
  
**Notebooks Included:**
- `5.1_Lists_Lesson.ipynb`: Learn how to create and use lists in Python.
- `5.2_Lists_Tutorial.ipynb`: Practice organizing and accessing data using lists.
- `5.3_Lists_Exercise.ipynb`: Exercises to enhance your understanding of lists.
